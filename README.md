# Marketing Website

## Description

As a marketing agency, I wanted a codebase that would follow accessibility standards. That way my own site is optimized for search engines. This assignment served as an introduction to web development, and working with github. It involved editing html and css in order to make the website functional and more accesible.

## Installation

I started with creating a new repository for this challenge on github. using git bash I created the new repository, I used the commands: git config --global init.defaultBranch main, mkdir git-challenge-1. I then used cd git-challenge-1 and created a index file with touch index.html. Then I checked the file with git status and then tracked the html file with git add -A and then commited the file using got commit -m "initial commit". I then created the remote repository in github with the same name git-challenge-1 and copied the SSH URL and used it in the command git remote add origin <SSH URL>, git branch -M main, git push -u origin main to connect the local repository to the remote repository on github. From here I had issues copying the challenge to the new repository. What I did was copied the challenge index.html file and css from the development folder in the challenge file that was located in the class repository and copied them to the new git-challenge-1 file from the VS code text editor. I ran a git push and git pull to confirm that the updates were pushed up to the remote repository on github.    

## Usage

The webpage meets accessibility standards, when I viewed the source code, I found semantic HTML elements. After viewing the structure of the HTML elements, I found that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. When I viewed the icon and image elements, I found accessible alt attributes. When viewing the heading attributes I found they fell in sequential order. When I viewed the title element I made a concise, descriptive title; the title of the html has been changed to "Horiseon homepage". The websites' top search links now function as intended, I CSS of has been reduced so there are no repetitive elements. The HTML has also been modified to flow correctly with the changes of the CSS.
